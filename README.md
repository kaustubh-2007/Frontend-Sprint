# AI-Assisted Frontend API Sprint

**Code Fast. Connect Smart. Deploy Instantly.**

Welcome to the ultimate 60-minute coding challenge. Your mission is to build a frontend web application from scratch, ingest data from a live public API, and use the **Groq LLM** to analyze, synthesize, or transform that data into an intelligent user experience. 

You have 60 minutes to build and deploy. AI coding assistants (ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot) are highly encouraged to help you write boilerplate and debug.

## 📅 Event Details
- **Time:** 10:00 PM – 11:00 PM
- **Duration:** Exactly 60 Minutes
- **Prerequisites:** Fully charged laptop, GitHub account, Vercel/Netlify account, and your favorite IDE.
- **Tech Stack:** Any frontend framework (React, Next.js, or Vanilla JS).

## 🧠 The Challenge: The "Data-to-Intelligence" Pipeline
This is not a standard data-fetching exercise. You must build an application that *thinks*. 

1. **The Fetch (Raw Material):** Grab raw data from one of the approved keyless public APIs.
2. **The Prompt (The Engine):** Pass that raw JSON data into Groq with a highly specific system prompt (e.g., translating it, roasting it, summarizing it, or predicting an outcome).
3. **The Render (The Product):** Display Groq's intelligent output on the frontend using a clean, responsive UI.

### 🔑 Groq LLM Integration
Groq uses an LPU architecture that is blazing fast—perfect for a time-crunched sprint. It is also fully compatible with the OpenAI SDK.
* **Endpoint:** `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions`
* **Hackathon Rule:** Because we do not have time to build secure backends, you may temporarily store your Groq API key in your frontend environment variables (`.env`). **You must revoke/delete your key immediately after judging!**
